# audio-file-tools
This repo is my general storage for home-made quick and dirty scripts/tools to manipulate audio files.

Help yourself, hope they're useful. For these, I'll probably not update them with any requests so please don't log issues.

I tested on MacOS and Linux; I've not used Windows in >15 years so who knows if they'll work over there.

Essentially I wanted solutions to take input audio files, remove the drum track (so they can be played along to by drummers), then do stuff to make them function better with Roland's extremely limited V71 song player!
